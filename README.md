A QOTD (Question of the Day) bot built for a special Discord server

<div align=left>

## Questionator

Questionator is a QOTD (Question of the Day) bot built for a special Discord server. Every 24 hours or so (by default it's set to use UTC), it will post a random question pulled from a DB. Users can add a question by simply using a command. Unlike most of the bots I develop, this bot is built using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) v2, not [Pycord](https://pycord.dev/) v2.

## Inviting the bot

Sorry, this bot is private. But you can self host a version of this bot. **It's fine if you self host one for demo or educational purposes, but do not skid the bot.**
